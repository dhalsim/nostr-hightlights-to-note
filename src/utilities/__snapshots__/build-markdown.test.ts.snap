    So true!&#x20;
  * One of the key differences between Nostr and other social media platforms is its decentralised architecture.
  * Nostr places a high emphasis on security and privacy for its users. All data on the platform is encrypted end-to-end and stored on decentralised servers. This means that only the user has control over their data and it is not stored in a central location that can be hacked or monitored.
  * Nostr is designed to be a community-driven platform. It encourages users to connect with others and build relationships, rather than simply posting content for likes and followers.
